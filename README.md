# Kieker

The internal behavior of large-scale software systems cannot be determined on the basis of static (e.g., source code) analysis alone. Kieker provides complementary dynamic analysis capabilities, i.e., monitoring and analyzing a software system’s runtime behavior — enabling application performance monitoring and architecture discovery.
